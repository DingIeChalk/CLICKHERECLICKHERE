  <p>[WELCOME TO HUXMARK! YOUR ONE-STOP PORTAL FOR THE SURREAL, THE GREATEST DEALS OF YOUR LIFE, AND THE ABSOLUTELY IRRESISTIBLE. NOW I BET YOU’RE WONDERING—“OH! OH! WHAT IS THIS? WHAT’S YOUR STORY?”]</p>
  <p>[WELL I’M GLAD YOU ASKED! HERE AT HUXMARK, WE HAVE ONLY ONE MISSION: TO GIVE YOU THE BEST DEALS IN THIS ENTIRE NARRATIVE!]</p>
  <p>[WHY, YOU MAY ASK? WELL AREN’T YOU NOSY! TELL YOU WHAT—VISIT EVERY PAGE ON THIS WEBSITE, AND I’LL GIVE YOU A TREAT. I’LL EVEN LET YOU IN ON HOW WE OPERATE... AND MAYBE OFFER A SPECIAL PRIZE OF THE GREEN VARIETY.]</p>

  <h2 class="glitch">[A FEW RULES!]</h2>
  <p>[CHEATERS ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS CHEAPSKATES.]</p>

  <p>[NO TRYING TO GET AROUND THE SITE ITSELF. THAT MEANS NO INSPECT ELEMENT, NO SOURCE CODE PEEKING, NO DEV TOOLS. I WORKED HARD ON THIS, AND I’LL BE DAMNED IF YOU CHEAT YOUR WAY THROUGH IT.]</p>

  <p>[NO AI FOR SOLVING PUZZLES. NO RIDDLES, NO BRUTE-FORCING, NO GPT THIS OR THAT. IF YOU NEED A BINARY-TO-TEXT SITE? FINE. BUT YOUR BRAIN DOES THE WORK, NOT YOUR BOTS.]</p>

  <p>[WRITE YOUR CODES DOWN. THE SITE WON’T REMEMBER THEM FOR YOU. I WON’T REMEMBER THEM FOR YOU. (I FORGET THINGS ON PURPOSE—IT’S PART OF THE CHARM.)]</p>

  <p>[NO SHARING WALKTHROUGHS OR CODES. THIS ISN’T A GROUP PROJECT. IF I WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THE SECRETS, I’D SCREAM THEM THROUGH A MEGAPHONE MADE OF TEETH.]</p>

  <p>[DON’T TRY TO RANDOMLY GUESS FUTURE URLS, BUT DO GUESS WITH INTENTION. DONT JUMP AHEAD, NO RANDOM SLASHES OR NUMBER COMBOS. YOU’LL JUST RUIN THE PACING—AND PROBABLY GET CONFUSED.]</p>

  <p>[IF IT FEELS LIKE CHEATING? DON’T DO IT. JUST ASK! I WON’T EVEN CHARGE YOU. IN FACT, I MIGHT GIVE YOU A HINT. MAYBE. (NO GUARANTEES.)]</p>

  <p>[IF SOMETHING BREAKS—OWN IT. IF YOU GLITCH THE SITE, LET ME KNOW. BUT DON’T ACT INNOCENT WHEN I SEE YOUR DIGITAL FINGERPRINTS INSIDE <a href="https://huxmark.com/log" style="color: #ff0059; text-decoration: none;">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</a> TAGS.]</p>

  <p>[ABOVE ALL ELSE: HAVE FUN. HAHA.]</p>
  <p>[OH—AND ONE MORE THING.]</p>
  <p>[THERE WILL BE A QUIZ AT THE END TO MAKE SURE YOU DID IT ALL RIGHT. HOPE YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION.]</p>
